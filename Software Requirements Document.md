*   **Contact Form Backend:** Use Next.js API Routes.
    *   Receive form data (POST request).
    *   Perform server-side validation and sanitization.
    *   Implement chosen anti-spam measure.
    *   Send email notification to designated company email address (use a transactional email service like SendGrid, Resend, or Nodemailer via SMTP).
    *   *(Optional):* Store submission in a database or Google Sheet via API.
    *   Return appropriate success/error JSON response to the frontend.
*   **CMS (Optional):** If chosen (e.g., Strapi, Contentful, Sanity), define API endpoints and data structures. Use SSG/ISR for fetching content at build time or incrementally.

### 3.6 Content Requirements
*   **Source:** Specify who provides text copy, images, videos, brand assets (logo).
*   **Placeholders:** Use realistic placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum is okay, but context-specific placeholders are better) and images (e.g., via Unsplash, Pexels, or dedicated placeholder services) during development.
*   **Image Optimization:**
    *   Use Next.js `<Image>` component for automatic optimization (WebP format, responsive sizes).
    *   Provide images in appropriate initial resolutions.
    *   Use SVGs for logos and icons where possible.
*   **Video:** Optimize for web streaming (correct formats, compression). Consider hosting on platforms like Vimeo/YouTube for better performance.

### 3.7 Error Handling
*   **Forms:** Display user-friendly validation errors near the relevant fields. Show clear success or failure messages upon submission attempt.
*   **API Failures:** Handle potential failures when submitting forms (network errors, server errors) gracefully on the frontend. Provide feedback to the user (e.g., "Submission failed, please try again later.").
*   **404 Page:** Create a custom, user-friendly 404 "Not Found" page consistent with the site design, including a link back to the homepage.
*   **General Errors:** Implement a custom `_error.js` (Pages Router) or `error.tsx` (App Router) page for handling unexpected runtime errors.

*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields, toggles) must be focusable and operable via keyboard alone, in a logical order. Implement visible focus indicators.
*   **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA roles and properties where necessary to enhance semantics for assistive technologies (e.g., for custom components, dynamic content updates).
*   **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient text/background contrast in both light and dark modes (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
*   **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) to ensure content is understandable and navigable. Provide `alt` text for all meaningful images.

### 4.3 SEO & Analytics
*   **On-Page SEO:**
    *   Unique, descriptive `<title>` tags and `meta description` for each page (can be generated dynamically based on content).
    *   Proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3...). One H1 per page.
    *   Use Next.js Metadata API (App Router) or `next-seo` library.
    *   Generate `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.
    *   Implement Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing.
    *   Use structured data (Schema.org - JSON-LD format) for Organization, Services, ContactPoint.
*   **Analytics:** Configure GA4 event tracking for key interactions (see 3.5). Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., consent management).

### 4.4 Security
*   **Form Security:** Implement CSRF protection if using API routes with state-changing actions (though less critical for simple contact forms if stateless). Sanitize all user input on the backend (API route) to prevent XSS. Validate file uploads (type, size).
